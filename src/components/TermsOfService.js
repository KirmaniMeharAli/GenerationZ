      <p>Last updated: November 15, 2024</p>
      <p>
        Welcome to our Terms of Service page! When you use our web services, you agree to these terms. Please read them carefully.
      </p>
      <h2>Using Our Services</h2>
      <p>
        You must follow any policies made available to you within the services. Don’t misuse our services. For example, don’t interfere with our services or try to access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.
      </p>
      <h2>Your Content in Our Services</h2>
      <p>
        Some of our services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive content. You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours.
      </p>
      <h2>Modifying and Terminating Our Services</h2>
      <p>
        We are constantly changing and improving our services. We may add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a service altogether. You can stop using our services at any time, although we’ll be sorry to see you go. We may also stop providing services to you, or add or create new limits to our services at any time.
      </p>
      <h2>Our Warranties and Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>
        We provide our services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we hope that you will enjoy using them. But there are certain things that we don’t promise about our services.
      </p>
      <h2>Liability for Our Services</h2>
      <p>
        When permitted by law, GenerationZ, and GenerationZ  suppliers and distributors, will not be responsible for lost profits, revenues, or data, financial losses, or indirect, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages.
      </p>
      <h2>About These Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our services. You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a service, you should discontinue your use of that service.
